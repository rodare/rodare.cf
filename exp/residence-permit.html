        <h2>Residence permit extension</h2>
        <h5>Aug 17, 2023</h5>
<p>

I submitted my application for the extension of my residence permit on April 3rd 2023. It may take up to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://migrant.poznan.uw.gov.pl/en/faq/what-makes-temporary-resident-card-stay-beyond-6-months-whereas-some-came-out-immediately-after" target="_blank"> 6 months to receive the result</a></span>, timeframe which I communicated during the Exist scholarship application. I received the decision earlier (on 19th July 2023). However, I found a little error on it because it said that I should work for a “minimum of 20 hours per week”,

          <span class="dots">...</span>
          <span class="more">

<span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">while the previous decision said “no more than 20 hours per week”. <a href="#">Link to the previous decision</a></span> 

          </span>
          <button class="read" style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">read more</button>
      

         <span class="dots">...</span>
          <span class="more">

<span style="color:purple;font-weight:bold">I found that this error came from the application files that were filled by FDK, because they forgot to write "no more than", and simply wrote "20 hours". So I requested FDK to send me a corrected version of those files as soon as possible, to comply with the appellation period of 14 days since the received decision. </span>

The government officer told me that it didn't matter because there is <span style="font-weight: bold;">no requirement to specify a number of hours on my type of contract</span>: 

          <span class="dots">...</span>
          <span class="more">

<span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">
“Contract for a specific activity” (<span style="font-weight: bold"> “umowa o dzieło” </span> in polish) is a type of contract that only requires: 1) the activity to perform, 2) the salary and 3) the completion date.  </span> 

          </span>
          <button class="read" style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">read more</button>
      

so my employer (FDK) can write any number of hours and it won't make a difference. Despite of this, I decided to request a correction of the decision 

          <span class="dots">...</span>
          <span class="more">

<span style="color:purple;font-weight:bold">
by submitting the corrected files (a copy of which I sent to Mrs. Patzer) and paying the fee of 220 zl involved in the process just to have the decision changed from: "minimum of 20 hours per week" to "no more than 20 hours per week". Although of course, it could have been any number of hours, </span> 

          </span>
          <button class="read" style="color:purple;font-weight:bold">read more</button>
just to avoid confusion for the EXIST, 

          <span class="dots">...</span>
          <span class="more">

<span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">which sets a maximum of 5 hours of work outside the EXIST program. With this requirement I also comply thanks to the letter I received from FDK (a copy of which I sent during the EXIST application and later via email to Mrs. Patzer)</span> 

          </span>
          <button class="read" style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">read more</button>

 Now I need to wait for about 2 months to receive the corrected decision.
